# Close similar tabs

The plugin has been totally reviewed working directly when opening files or links.
  
This plugin prevents you from having duplicate tabs in Obsidian by preventing from opening them, 
Notice it's working in all situations, when clicking on a link or when opening a file, and in several windows. 

2 modes:  
- "by window": find duplicates in each window (default mode).  
- "All windows": find duplicates in all windows. 
  
2 commands:      
- "Switch" to temporary enable/disable Close Similar Tabs.
- "Undo close tab" to make the last closed tab reappear. (it seems that this obsidian command was removed from the command palette)

N.B: More options are getting back soon as close empty tabs, be notified and  pinned tabs.

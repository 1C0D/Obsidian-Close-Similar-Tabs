# Close similar tabs

This plugin prevents you from having duplicate tabs in Obsidian by automatically closing them.  
By default, it closes duplicates within each window, but users can turn off the "Close by window" setting to apply the check in all windows. With this setting off, it's impossible to have the same tab open twice anywhere in your Obsidian workspace.

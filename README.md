# Close similar tabs

This plugin prevents you from having duplicate tabs in Obsidian by automatically closing them.  
By default, it closes duplicates within each window, but users can set the "Close by window" setting to "Current window only" or "All windows". With this second setting, it's impossible to have the same tab open twice anywhere in your Obsidian workspace.

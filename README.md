# Close similar tabs

New: works too when middle clicking on a link 

This plugin prevents you from having duplicate tabs in Obsidian by preventing from opening them, 
It's working in all situations, when clicking on a link or when opening a file, and on several windows or split windows. 

2 modes:  
- "by window": find duplicates in each window (default mode).  
- "All windows": find duplicates in all windows. 
  
1 command:      
- "Switch" to temporary enable/disable Close Similar Tabs.
